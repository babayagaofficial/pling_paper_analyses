# Creating and visualising trees for Addenbrookes hospital isolates

The trees where generated by running parsnp with the commands:

```
parsnp -r ! -d ../fastas/addenbrookes_chr/ecoli -p 4 -o ecoli
parsnp -r ! -d ../fastas/addenbrookes_chr/kleb -p 4 -o kleb
```

The visualisations were then generated with:

```
python draw_tree.py ecoli
python draw_tree.py kleb
```

Note that the tree file needs to be named `ecoli_cpe.tree` (`kleb_cpe.tree`) and in the same directory as the script for it to work. Also, make sure to remove the `.fna` file endings from the labels if you choose to visualise with your own tree from the parsnp commands described above.
